# Big-Tic-Tac-Toe
A large game board version of Tic Tac Toe written in C to utilize several AI techniques.

This application is my first dive into the C programming language, and will help me learn both the minimax AI programming methodology and the syntax/logic of C. Also, instead of creating an ordinary Tic Tac Toe game, it is a 5X5 version with tweaked rules in order to keep the game interesting as well as a little more challenging for the computer to process in terms of move decision making.

While this program is simple to compile in a UNIX terminal, I will continue to upload the compiled application as well as the source code.


To compile in a UNIX terminal:

cd to the source code's folder and use the following command: "gcc main.c -o tictactoe"

And finally use this command to run the compiled code: "./tictactoe"
